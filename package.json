  "description": "Second Re-iteration of my submission, because i've done a bad things, pretty much i've finished all of the features, but didn't test everytime a new feature implemented and it was grave mistake only did the testing after everything was done and debugging it was a mistake. Where it should have been like this, new feature implemented => test feature => continue fixing/implementing feature. so i decided to restart it again",
